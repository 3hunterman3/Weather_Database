# Weather_Database_challenge_6

### Overview
- This challenge was to be use API keys with efficiency and learn how I can pull data from Google and OpenWeather to get the data I need to plan my trips. The idea was to be able to utilize these tools to travel and go to different areas of the world. This project allowed me to analyze the weather across cities useing data from OpenWeather. This allowed me to set a range of temperatures I would like to vacation in and let me set limits to certain areas of the world.


### Vacation spots
Choosing from different areas is hard so I chose places in europe I would like to go and set the areas pretty close to one another.
